# `DLNFibre.DLN.RLCT.Engine.EngineConstruction` — the construction's termination spine (rung 2)

**Blueprint spine: statements are forecasts; churn is normal.** The double-induction that builds the
resolution tree (the `monomialization_terminates` hole) runs on a lean carrier `ConState` and is
proven to terminate by a lex-triple measure `μ = (L+1−S, layerCap−J, pendingCount)` on the lex
product `ℕ ×ₗ ℕ ×ₗ ℕ`.
This module pins the well-founded machinery BEFORE the recursion body: the carrier, its invariant,
the measure, and the well-founded relation — mirroring the banked `RouteMState` idiom
(`ℕ ×ₗ ℕ ×ₗ ℕ`, `toLex` nesting, `InvImage.wf _ wellFounded_lt`).

The carrier stores ONLY what the measure reads: the layer `S`, the cleared-pivot count `J`, and the
current divisor ledger (count + per-divisor exponent `M_{s,k}` and clearing level `t̃_{s,k}`).
DERIVABLE data (`resRows`/`resCols`/`numB`/`runLen`/`depth`/`minAdm`) is NOT stored — it is computed
from `M`, `S`, `J`. Distinct from the tree-node `StepData` (which materialises the derivable fields
for the certificate); `ConState` is the recursion carrier only.

Per-case descent (rung 2B) lives below the measure: a case-1(1) merge drops component 3
(`pendingCount`); a case-1(2)/case-2 step drops component 2 (`J` advances by one); a layer rollover
drops component 1 (`S` advances). No case decreases NOTHING — the termination kill-condition.

/-! ## The termination carrier + invariant -/

/-- **The construction's termination carrier** (rung 2): the double-induction state stripped to what
the measure reads. `layer` is `S`, `cleared` is `J`, and `(numDiv, divExp, divTilde)` is the current
exceptional-divisor ledger (`M_{s,k}` and `t̃_{s,k}`). No derivable field is stored. -/
structure ConState where
  /-- The layer index `S`. -/
  layer : ℕ
  /-- The count `J` of unit pivots cleared in the current layer. -/
  cleared : ℕ
  /-- Number of exceptional divisors currently in scope. -/
  numDiv : ℕ
  /-- The per-divisor exponent ledger `M_{s,k}`. -/
  divExp : Fin numDiv → ℕ
  /-- The per-divisor clearing level `t̃_{s,k}`. -/
  divTilde : Fin numDiv → ℕ

/-- The within-layer ceiling on `J` (`cleared`): the total width `∑ M`, a fixed upper bound on the
cleared count in any layer (`J ≤ M(S) ≤ ∑ M`, and `J` resets to `0` at a rollover). Used as μ's 2nd
lex component's ceiling so `layerCap − J` strictly drops when `J` advances. -/
def layerCap (M : Fin (L + 1) → ℕ) : ℕ := ∑ i, M i

/-- **The pending-divisor count**: divisors whose clearing level exceeds the current cleared count
(`t̃_k > J`). μ's third lex component. A case-1(1) merge moves its target divisor's `t̃` down to
`J`, so this drops by one; the other cases leave it dominated by a strict drop in a higher
component. -/
def ConState.pendingCount (s : ConState) : ℕ :=
  (Finset.univ.filter (fun k : Fin s.numDiv => s.cleared < s.divTilde k)).card

/-- **The state invariant** (rung 2; shape-locked, detail loose). The layer has not overshot the
chain (`S ≤ L`) and the cleared count has not overshot the within-layer ceiling (`J ≤ layerCap`).
These are the facts the descent lemmas' strict preconditions refine (a rollover needs `S ≤ L`; a
`J`-advancing step needs `J < layerCap`). -/

/-- **The termination measure** `μ = lex(L+1−S, layerCap−J, pendingCount)` on `ℕ ×ₗ ℕ ×ₗ ℕ`
(well-founded — the banked `RouteMState` idiom). Component 1 drops at a layer rollover, component 2
at a `J`-advancing case-1(2)/case-2 step, component 3 at a case-1(1) merge. -/

def conRel (M : Fin (L + 1) → ℕ) (s t : ConState) : Prop := conMeasure M s < conMeasure M t

/-- `conRel` is well-founded (pullback of `<` on the lex triple along `conMeasure`). Mirrors the
banked `routeRel_wf`; the lex-`<` is well-founded via the `WellFoundedLT (α ×ₗ β)` instance. -/
