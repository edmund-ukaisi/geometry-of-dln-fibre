# Thread 03 - block and product reduction

Type: formalisation. Status: blocked.

## Task

Formalise Aoyagi's elementary matrix reductions: the full-rank block elimination
and product reduction.

## Output contract

- Lean statements for Claim A1 and Claim A2 at exact scope.
- Proofs where elementary; any analytic/local hypotheses named explicitly.
- Statement cards at AUDIT time.

## Controller notes

Read `lean/CLAUDE.md` before Lean work. Keep Aoyagi/DLN application code out of
`DLNFibre.Core`.

## 2026-06-18 A1 narrow tide

Opened xhigh worker tide `Lovelace` for the first Lean implementation. Scope is
only Aoyagi Lemma 2's checked algebraic block-elimination chart identity, and
possibly the rank formula if it falls out without overclaiming. Explicitly out
of scope: RLCT invariance, local-germ/ideal consequences, Theorem 3 product
reduction, and target-normalisation claims.

Read-only xhigh statement reviewer `Euclid` was also opened to audit the exact
statement shape before controller acceptance.

Outcome: landed two algebraic block identities in
`lean/DLNFibre/DLN/Aoyagi/BlockElimination.lean`:
`schurComplement_leftBlockElim_fromBlocks` and
`schurComplement_blockElim_fromBlocks`. Theorems are over `[CommRing K]` with
explicit chart hypothesis `IsUnit A1.det`, and contain no rank/RLCT/germ/ideal
claim. Controller verified targeted build, full `DLNFibre` build, and
`scripts/sorries`. Statement card:
`statement-card-a1-block-identities.md`.

Remaining A1 target: rank formula as a separate theorem, likely via a
block-diagonal rank lemma over a field. A2 remains blocked by the checker
findings: source-faithful basis/open-chart hypotheses and analytic-boundary
decision.

## 2026-06-18 A1 rank-formula tide

Opened xhigh worker tide `Lovelace` to prove a separate block-diagonal rank
theorem and then the Schur-complement rank corollary. Scope remains purely
algebraic: no RLCT/germ/ideal/Theorem 3 claim.

Outcome: landed `rank_fromBlocks_zero_zero` and
`rank_fromBlocks_eq_card_add_rank_schurComplement_of_isUnit_det` in
`lean/DLNFibre/DLN/Aoyagi/BlockElimination.lean`. Controller verified targeted
build, full `DLNFibre` build, and `scripts/sorries`. Xhigh reviewer `Euclid`
accepted after minor docstring/name edits. Rank statement card:
`statement-card-a1-rank-formula.md`.
