# Thread 04 - blow-up certificate

Type: pen-and-paper/formalisation. Status: blocked.

## Task

Turn Aoyagi's recursive Case 1 / Case 2 blow-up bookkeeping into a formal
transition invariant or certificate, then prove the certificate matches the
coordinate substitutions.

## Output contract

- A finite state representation of the exponent/vector bookkeeping.
- Explicit source correspondence for every transition and terminal case.
- A completeness argument for the case split, with a decorrelated
  counterexample hunt before treating it as established.
- Lean implementation only after the certificate shape is stable.

## Controller notes

This is likely the crux. Build small infrastructure if it reduces proof risk.
Do not mimic prose geometry if a certificate gives a cleaner Lean target.

## 2026-06-18 check result

Draft reproduction: `reproduction-draft.md`. Independent checker:
`Copernicus`, saved at `reproduction-check.md`.

Status: not formalisation-ready. The certificate must first separate actual
layer widths `M^{(S+1)}` from prefix minima `M(S+1)`, repair the Case 1/2
transition updates, cover missing pivot charts, prove regularity/divisibility
for the `P` matrices, and replace the unstable termination measure.
