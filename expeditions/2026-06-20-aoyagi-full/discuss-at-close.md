# Discuss-at-close — items for operator review (charge-ahead by default)

Per operator (2026-06-24): "record design decisions / things to discuss at the end of the expedition in
a doc; by default charge ahead." This is that doc. Controller decides autonomously now; these are flagged
for an eventual operator sanity-check at close (not blockers).

## 1. L2-PIN soundness reconciliation (DECISION I'm making autonomously)
`fm2/split-reindex` carries soundness CORRECTIONS the integration base lacks (the base took `fold3-close`'s
versions): "#120 CORRECT deepestEPivot `_deriv` spec =fst→shear-CLE (name=content)" + "DeepestGaugeChart
correct dE(0)=id overclaim (g163)" + frame-as-DATA. `sub34` has the bulk PIN modules split-reindex lacks.
**Plan:** at L2-wiring, cherry-pick split-reindex's corrections onto the chosen base PIN modules, per-file,
verifying name=content (NOT a blind merge). **For close:** sanity-check the final reconciled `_deriv` spec
is the shear-CLE (not =fst) and the dE(0)=id is not overclaimed — these gate L2 soundness.

## 2. θ analytic seam (KNOWN at-risk, brief standing decision 6)
The combinatorial order `θ=a(ℓ−a)+1` (A2) is landable from the same `(ℓ,a)` data. The ANALYTIC identity
"combinatorial count = pole multiplicity" needs meromorphic continuation Mathlib lacks. **Plan:** land
combinatorial θ fully; the analytic=combinatorial step rides inside the S2 interface for λ, but as an
independent θ statement it needs the order-tracking monomial rule. **For close:** decide whether to (a)
land combinatorial θ + flag the analytic seam honestly, or (b) attempt the analytic bridge. Default (a).

## 3. RRR general-L-first API (design caveat)
RRR-Lean (#17) defines the L=2 model + Thm-1; the headline `aoyagiLambda` API must stay general-L-first,
with RRR exposed as the L=2 INSTANCE — NOT RRR-first. **For close:** confirm RRR is a thin instance of the
general theorem, not a parallel API.

## 4. hMid / non-degeneracy carve-out (#70, audit-corrected to non-strict)
Headline is non-strict (`∀s, r ≤ H_s`, paper-faithful); the degenerate boundary (some reduced width =0)
routes via a direct-Morse lemma (#70), not the decomposition (which gives ⊤ there). **For close:** confirm
the degenerate-boundary handling is sound + the carve-out is named honestly ("DLNs mildly singular" caveat).

## 5. The one cited axiom (S2) — confirm at close
`monomial_rlct` (normal-crossing→RLCT) is the ONLY permitted citation. **For close:** `#print axioms
aoyagi_learning_coefficient` shows only `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound, monomial_rlct]` (no
sorryAx, no native_decide) — the closing criterion.

(Append items as they arise during the autonomous charge.)

## 6. R1 is the LONG POLE — two mountains (controller charging ahead; for awareness)
The R1 gate (`resolution_charts` / general-M `routeStep`) is the genuine long pole. `routestep-read`
(triple+Codex) found the existing `ChainDimSplit` carrier is fixed-arity and cannot express the
layer-collapsing minAdm recursion `minAdm(M₀,…,M_L)=min_t[(M₀−t)(M₁−t)+minAdm(t,M₂,…,M_L)]` —
r1-135-design's "bounded construction" was over-optimistic. The MATH is validated (layer-collapsing =
Aoyagi's layer-peeling + the #18 depth-recursion); the Lean CARRIER needs re-architecting. TWO lanes:
(1) the **LayerSplit re-architecture** (layer-collapsing carrier + routeAtlas recurse on (L',red) + the
descent cert generalised to the collapsed chain) — BUILDING (`layersplit-rearch`, validate-first);
(2) the **general-M `IsRouteMCover`** (only the (2,2,2) atoms exist) — separate, not yet started. The
headline `aoyagi_learning_coefficient` stays honest-conditional on R1. I'm driving both lanes; flagging
because R1 closing is the main remaining effort and may take significant time. NOT a wall — a precise
re-arch path; each prior R1 dead-end (per-node Morse, §8 one-shot, threshold-only-corank≥2, ChainDimSplit
carrier) was caught honestly before building on it.

### Item 1 — L2-PIN reconciliation ASSESSED (heartbeat 2026-06-24 ~09:43)
The #120 EPivot shear-CLE correction + the dE(0)=id overclaim fix span BOTH `DeepestGaugeChart` and
`DeepestSplitReindex` (split-reindex also adds `deepestSplitHomeo` + MP/basepoint theorems). FIVE base
modules consume these: DeepestSchurShift, DeepestFramedProduct, DeepestGaugeChart, DeepestGaugeConstruction,
DeepestTelescoping. So this is NOT a clean cherry-pick — replacing the base's (fold3-close) versions risks
breaking the 5 consumers. PLAN: do it as a DELIBERATE controller-supervised step during the L2 gate-drive
(an active gauge-chart build surfaces what the proof needs), verifying name=content (the _deriv spec is the
shear-CLE, not =fst) + that all 5 consumers still build. NOT rushed in parallel with the R1 long-pole.
